"# WorkingSharpBlock" 

Removed a lot of features from SharpBlock. Not useful for me . Also removed dynamic invoke features .. Wanted to have a working copy of sharpblockfirst which works on both x86 and x64. The orginal ones sometimes crashes on x86 because of unhealthy implementation of Context. Guess This one works fine .. Hopefully atleast .. Anyhow it works so enjoy
